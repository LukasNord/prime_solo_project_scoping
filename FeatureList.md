### Purpose

The User of this application will be a person who is interested in tracking their speech statistics over time. 
The user will have a unique login and can input their speech statistics into the application and then view those statistics over time with data visualization tools.  Additionally, the user will be able to add comments to their speech events as well as delete them.

### Feature List Priority for MVP

1. Storage of speech data in a database:
    - User can create a private event which is catalogued by date.  User's can create an event with any date they choose. * Date Required *
    - User will then be able to track speech statistics for that particular event and save it. (Umm's, ah's, like, so, etc...)
    - User can add comments to this event prior to saving or at a later date.

    - * A private event is an event only visiable or interactable by the user who created it. 

2. User Dashboard:
    - User will have a view that allows them to see all past events and edit them or add comments.  
    - User will have a reports module that allows them to select a date range and then have a visual representation of their data over time.
        - Sub features: 
            - Break data down by each category to see a particular speech pattern over time.
            - Show aggregated data over time. 


3. Admin Dashboard:
    - Admin can view all aggregate data across all users.  
    - Strech goals are primarly around additional admin functionality.

## Strech Goals/Features

1. Add features to Administrator role to allow creating a 'Public Event'.
    - Public event would be viewable by all users of the system.
    - Public event would have roles that can be signed up for by the users of the application.
    - Notifications and resources could be sent to users based on the role they signed up for.
